-  **Added iOS-compatible models** - Created `IosIngestPayload` and related structures to handle iOS JSON format
-  **Implemented dual-format parsing** - Server now accepts both iOS and standard JSON formats
-  **Increased payload size limit** - Raised Actix-web payload limit to 100MB for large health data uploads
-  **Enhanced debug logging** - Added comprehensive request logging and authentication debugging
-  **Successful health data sync** - iOS app now successfully uploads large health datasets (935,000+ lines)

## Code Quality Improvements (2025-09-09)
-  **Fixed all clippy warnings** - Resolved unused imports, format strings, and code style issues
-  **Updated documentation** - Refreshed CLAUDE.md with current project structure
