### Commit: 2a73133 - docs: complete Story 2.2 - Create Symptoms Tracking Table
**Risk Level:** Low
#### Findings:
1. **[DOCUMENTATION] Documentation updates only** - No performance or architectural impact
   - Issue: Moving completed stories between documentation files
   - Suggestion: Continue tracking comprehensive implementation
   - Reviewer: AGENT-2

### Commit: c6c0558 - feat: implement comprehensive symptoms tracking table with 67+ symptom types
**Risk Level:** Medium  
#### Findings:
1. **[PERFORMANCE] migrations/0014_create_symptoms.sql:379 lines**
   - Issue: Very large migration file with 67+ symptoms enum and complex partitioning
   - Suggestion: Consider breaking into smaller migrations for easier rollback/deployment
   - Reviewer: AGENT-2

2. **[ARCHITECTURE] migrations/0014_create_symptoms.sql:56-99**
   - Issue: Large CHECK constraint with 67 symptom types in single constraint
   - Suggestion: Consider enum type instead of CHECK constraint for better performance and maintainability
   - Reviewer: AGENT-2

3. **[PERFORMANCE] migrations/0014_create_symptoms.sql:156-223**
   - Issue: Multiple BRIN indexes created during partition setup could impact initial creation time

**Risk Level:** Medium
#### Findings:
1. **[PERFORMANCE] migrations/0013_create_nutrition_metrics.sql:80-158**
   - Issue: 37+ separate CHECK constraints - each constraint evaluated on every INSERT
   - Suggestion: Consolidate validation logic or move to application layer for performance
   - Reviewer: AGENT-2

2. **[ARCHITECTURE] migrations/0013_create_nutrition_metrics.sql:NUMERIC precision**
   - Issue: Mixed NUMERIC(8,2) and NUMERIC(8,3) precision across fields
   - Suggestion: Standardize precision unless specific requirements demand variation

**Risk Level:** High
#### Findings:
1. **[ARCHITECTURE] DATA.md:313 lines**
   - Issue: Large static data mapping file (313 lines) loaded at compile time
   - Suggestion: Consider database-driven mapping or lazy loading for memory efficiency
   - Reviewer: AGENT-2

2. **[PERFORMANCE] src/handlers/ingest_async_simple.rs:80-second timeout**
   - Issue: Very high timeout (80s) for async endpoint could tie up connection pools
   - Suggestion: Consider background job processing for large payloads instead of long timeouts
   - Reviewer: AGENT-2

3. **[ARCHITECTURE] src/handlers/ingest_async_simple.rs:125-135**
   - Issue: Conditional batch configuration logic based on payload size adds complexity
   - Suggestion: Consider unified configuration with auto-scaling batch sizes
   - Reviewer: AGENT-2

   - Reviewer: AGENT-2

2. **[ARCHITECTURE] migrations/0012_create_activity_metrics_v2.sql:160-184**
   - Issue: Function `create_partition_indexes` hardcodes table-specific logic
   - Suggestion: Use metadata-driven approach for index creation patterns
   - Reviewer: AGENT-2

**Risk Level:** Low
#### Findings:
1. **[PERFORMANCE] src/services/rate_limiter.rs:IP rate limit increased**

   - Reviewer: AGENT-3

### Commit: f7906ca - feat: implement dual-write pattern for activity_metrics
**Risk Level:** High
#### Findings:
1. **[TESTING] tests/handlers/ingest_test.rs**
   - Issue: Dual-write integration tests are mostly unit tests, lack full integration testing
   - Suggestion: Add integration tests that verify data consistency between old and new tables with real database transactions
   - Reviewer: AGENT-3

2. **[TESTING] Missing test coverage**
   - Issue: No tests for dual-write rollback scenarios when activity_metrics_v2 insert fails but original succeeds
   - Suggestion: Create tests that simulate partial failure conditions and verify data consistency

### Commit: bd2b551 - fix: support Auto Export UUID-based API keys for iOS app compatibility
**Risk Level:** High
#### Findings:
1. **[SECURITY] src/services/auth.rs:159-280**
   - Issue: Dual authentication system accepts both UUID and hashed API keys, UUID keys bypass hashing
   - Suggestion: Ensure UUID keys have equivalent security validation and audit logging as hashed keys
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

2. **[SECURITY] src/services/auth.rs:166-203**
   - Issue: Direct UUID lookup without rate limiting or brute force protection for UUID keys
   - Suggestion: Apply same rate limiting and authentication attempt tracking to UUID-based authentication
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

3. **[QUALITY] src/services/auth.rs:231-243**
   - Issue: SQL query uses string pattern matching "LIKE '$argon2%'" which could miss edge cases
   - Suggestion: Use more robust hash format detection or separate hash type column in database
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

### Commit: a1c5a21 - security: implement comprehensive CORS middleware for production API
**Risk Level:** Medium
#### Findings:
1. **[SECURITY] src/main.rs:268-272**
   - Issue: Production CORS validation uses panic!() for wildcard origins which could crash server
   - Suggestion: Use proper error handling instead of panic!() to gracefully reject invalid configurations
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

2. **[SECURITY] src/main.rs:240-245**
   - Issue: CORS origin parsing splits on ',' without trimming, could lead to whitespace bypass
   - Suggestion: Already properly handled with trim() - good security practice
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

### Commit: f7906ca - feat: implement dual-write pattern for activity_metrics
**Risk Level:** Medium
#### Findings:
1. **[QUALITY] src/handlers/ingest.rs:532-546**
   - Issue: Error logging exposes potentially sensitive payload data in error messages
   - Suggestion: Sanitize payload preview to avoid logging sensitive health data in error logs
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

2. **[QUALITY] src/services/batch_processor.rs:Multiple locations**
   - Issue: No explicit error handling for dual-write consistency failures, could lead to data inconsistency
   - Suggestion: Add explicit transaction rollback and consistency checks for dual-write operations
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

### Commit: 39d5f10 - feat: implement comprehensive payload monitoring for security analysis
**Risk Level:** Low
#### Findings:
1. **[QUALITY] src/handlers/ingest.rs:118-128**

   - Suggestion: Add memory consumption monitoring and limits to prevent memory exhaustion attacks
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

2. **[SECURITY] src/handlers/ingest.rs:95-115**
   - Issue: Good security practice - proper client IP extraction and audit logging implementation
   - Suggestion: Continue monitoring for IP spoofing attempts in production logs
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

### Commit: 295bb5e - feat: implement timeout-resistant async ingest endpoint to fix Cloudflare 524 errors
**Risk Level:** Medium
#### Findings:
1. **[QUALITY] src/handlers/ingest_async_simple.rs:74-88**
   - Issue: Timeout protection on JSON parsing (10 seconds) but no validation of JSON depth/complexity
   - Suggestion: Add JSON parsing limits for depth and object count to prevent billion laughs attacks
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

2. **[SECURITY] src/handlers/ingest_async_simple.rs:17-80**
   - Issue: 80-second timeout could be abused for resource exhaustion if many concurrent requests initiated
   - Suggestion: Implement connection limit per IP and user to prevent timeout-based DoS attacks
   - Reviewer: AGENT-1

### Commit: e1d52c7 - fix: complete AUDIT-001 rate limiting improvements to resolve iOS upload failures
