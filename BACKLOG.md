# Health Export REST API - Development Backlog

## Executive Summary

This backlog contains comprehensive Jira stories derived from multi-agent analysis of the Health Export REST API project. The project currently exists as complete architectural documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) but has zero implementation - all previous Python FastAPI code was deleted, leaving only documentation and planning files.

## Strategic Decision Required

**CRITICAL**: Before starting any development work, a strategic decision is required between two paths:

### Path A: Python Enhancement (60% Less Effort)
Restore the deleted Python FastAPI implementation and enhance it with missing components.

### Path B: Rust Rewrite (Architecture Compliant)  
Complete greenfield Rust implementation following ARCHITECTURE.md specification exactly.

**All stories below are organized by these two paths with clear effort estimates and dependencies.**

## Technical Debt Stories

### STORY-016: Clean Up Git History and Project Structure
**Epic**: EPIC-001  
**Priority**: P3  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Type**: Technical Debt  

**Description:**  
As a developer, I need a clean git history and properly organized project structure so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

**Background:**  
- .gitignore contains both Python and Rust patterns with duplicates
- Git history shows technology transition that wasn't properly documented
- Project structure needs organization based on chosen technology path

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Clean up .gitignore file:
  - Remove duplicate Python patterns (lines 182+)
  - Keep only patterns relevant to chosen technology stack
  - Add any missing patterns for development tools
- [ ] Organize project structure:
  - Remove unnecessary files and directories
  - Ensure consistent naming conventions
  - Add proper directory structure for chosen path
- [ ] Document git history decisions:
  - Add CHANGELOG.md documenting major changes
  - Document technology transition reasoning
  - Tag important commits for reference
- [ ] Set up development standards:
  - Code formatting configuration
  - Linting rules and pre-commit hooks
  - Contributing guidelines for new developers

**Definition of Done:**  
- .gitignore is clean and relevant
- Project structure follows conventions
- Development standards are documented and enforced
- Git history is properly documented

**Dependencies:** STORY-001 (tech decision affects cleanup scope)  
**Related Issues:** File Explorer - .gitignore confusion identified

## Effort Estimation Notes

**Story Point Scale**: Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)  
- 1-2 points: Simple tasks, documentation updates, configuration  
- 3-5 points: Standard features, moderate complexity implementation
- 8-13 points: Complex features requiring multiple components
- 21+ points: Epic-level work that should be broken down further

**Velocity Assumptions**: 
- Single developer: ~10-15 points per sprint (2 weeks)
- Team of 2-3 developers: ~25-40 points per sprint
- Includes time for code review, testing, documentation

**Risk Factors**:
- Path A: Lower risk, building on known working implementation
- Path B: Higher risk, greenfield development with new technology stack
- Cross-cutting: Infrastructure setup can have unexpected complexity

3. **Phase 2**: Execute P1 stories based on chosen path
4. **Phase 3**: P2 and P3 stories for feature completion and optimization

**Success Metrics**:
- All P0 and P1 stories completed successfully
- API functional with authentication, rate limiting, and basic monitoring
