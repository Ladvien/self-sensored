Status: ANALYZING QUERIES

🚨 **CRITICAL FINDINGS - SCHEMA MISMATCH ISSUES**

**Broken Queries by File:**

**raw_ingestions table issues:**
- `/mnt/datadrive_m2/self-sensored/src/handlers/optimized_ingest.rs:337` - INSERT uses `api_key_id, raw_data, data_hash` columns
- `/mnt/datadrive_m2/self-sensored/src/handlers/optimized_ingest.rs:339` - CONFLICT uses `ingested_at` column  
- `/mnt/datadrive_m2/self-sensored/src/handlers/payload_processor.rs:288` - INSERT uses `api_key_id, raw_data, data_hash` columns
- `/mnt/datadrive_m2/self-sensored/src/handlers/ingest.rs:515` - INSERT uses `api_key_id, raw_data, data_hash` columns

- `/mnt/datadrive_m2/self-sensored/src/handlers/ingest_async_simple.rs:211` - UPDATE uses `status, error_message` columns

**Schema vs Query Column Mismatches:**
- Schema has: `payload_hash, payload_size_bytes, raw_payload, processing_status, processing_errors`
- Queries expect: `api_key_id, raw_data, data_hash, ingested_at, status, error_message`

**Health Metrics Tables - Missing Tables:**
- `/mnt/datadrive_m2/self-sensored/src/services/batch_processor.rs` - References deleted tables:
  - `nutrition_metrics` (deleted in migration cleanup)
  - `symptoms` (deleted in migration cleanup) 
  - `reproductive_health_metrics` (deleted in migration cleanup)
  - `environmental_metrics` (deleted in migration cleanup)
  - `mental_health_metrics` (deleted in migration cleanup)
  - `mobility_metrics` (deleted in migration cleanup)

**Column Name Mismatches:**
- `activity_metrics.recorded_date` vs `activity_metrics.recorded_at` (schema uses `recorded_at`)
- `blood_pressure_metrics.source` vs `blood_pressure_metrics.source_device` (schema uses `source_device`)
- `sleep_metrics.sleep_efficiency` vs `sleep_metrics.efficiency` (schema uses `efficiency`) 
- `workouts.average_heart_rate` vs `workouts.avg_heart_rate` (schema uses `avg_heart_rate`)

- `/mnt/datadrive_m2/self-sensored/src/services/auth.rs:650` - References `audit_log` table (doesn't exist in schema)

**Critical Query Failures:**
1. **All raw ingestion INSERT operations will fail** - Wrong column names
2. **All health metric processing will fail** - References deleted tables  
3. **User authentication queries will fail** - Missing columns in users/api_keys tables
4. **Activity metrics queries mixed between v1/v2** - Inconsistent table references

- `symptoms`
- `reproductive_health_metrics`
- `environmental_metrics` 
- `mental_health_metrics`
- `mobility_metrics`
