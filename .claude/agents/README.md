## Team Statistics
- **Total Subagents**: 14
- **Component Specialists**: 7 (api, database, auth, data, cache, devops, monitoring)
- **Core Coordinators**: 3 (architecture-validator, integration-coordinator, test-orchestrator)
- **Domain Experts**: 4 (batch-processing, performance, ios-integration, hipaa-compliance)

## Architecture Coverage
âœ… **Complete Coverage**: All major components and domains from ARCHITECTURE.md
âœ… **Specialized Expertise**: Each subagent focuses on specific architectural concerns
âœ… **Quality Assurance**: Core coordinators ensure compliance and integration
âœ… **Domain Knowledge**: Specialists for iOS integration, HIPAA compliance, performance

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Delegate to specific specialists
"Use the api-developer to implement the /v1/ingest endpoint"
"Have the database-architect optimize the query performance"
"Ask the hipaa-compliance-officer to review data handling"

# Coordinate across team
"Get the architecture-validator to review this change"
"Have the integration-coordinator verify the API contracts"
"Ask the test-orchestrator to ensure coverage"

# Full team coordination
"Deploy the entire subagent team to fix the compilation errors"
"Have the team review the system for ARCHITECTURE.md compliance"
```

## Team Coordination
- Each subagent validates work against source architecture documents
- Core coordinators ensure cross-cutting concerns are addressed
- Specialized agents handle domain-specific requirements
- All agents follow CLAUDE.md conventions and REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md standards
