## ⚠️ MIGRATION REFERENCES NOTICE
**Historical Context**: This file contains references to migration files and expanded schema features that were part of the expanded schema implementation but have been removed as part of the schema simplification (SCHEMA-016). All references to migration files, nutrition metrics, symptoms, reproductive health metrics, environmental metrics, mental health metrics, and mobility metrics are historical and relate to work completed before schema simplification to the core 5 metric types.

#### [SCHEMA-007] Fix Source Field Mapping ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED 2025-09-12  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Assigned to:** Claude Code Agent  
**Priority:** High

Fix all 'source' field references to 'source_device' across all health metric models, iOS conversion logic, and database struct mappings to align with the simplified schema.

**Acceptance Criteria Completed:**
- ✅ Updated iOS models (IosMetricData, IosWorkout) to use source_device field instead of source
- ✅ Fixed iOS to internal format conversion logic to use data_point.source_device
- ✅ Updated iOS workout conversion to use ios_workout.source_device 
- ✅ All health metric models already used source_device correctly (HeartRateMetric, BloodPressureMetric, SleepMetric, ActivityMetric, WorkoutData)
- ✅ Database struct mappings already aligned with source_device field naming

**Files Modified:**

**Technical Details:**
- **User Schema Alignment**: User struct now matches users table exactly (id, email, apple_health_id, created_at, updated_at, is_active, metadata)
- **ApiKey Schema Alignment**: ApiKey struct matches api_keys table exactly (id, user_id, name, created_at, expires_at, last_used_at, is_active, permissions, rate_limit_per_hour)
- **Query Compatibility**: All SQL queries now reference only columns that exist in the simplified schema
- **Audit Logging**: Converted to structured logging approach since audit_log table doesn't exist
- **Type Safety**: All struct field types match database column types for proper SQLx mapping

**Impact:** Authentication system now fully compatible with simplified database schema. All authentication operations (login, API key management, user creation) will work correctly with the updated schema structure. Eliminates runtime database errors from referencing non-existent columns.

**Quality Assurance:** Changes maintain backward compatibility for authentication flows while aligning with current database structure. Structured logging preserves audit capability without requiring additional database tables.

- ✅ **INSERT Query Updates:**
  - Added payload_size_bytes calculation for all INSERT operations
  - Removed api_key_id references (column doesn't exist)
  - Updated to use payload_hash instead of data_hash
  - Added raw_payload JSONB field for complete payload storage

**Impact:** Eliminates all "column does not exist" database errors related to raw_ingestions table operations. All ingestion endpoints (REST API, MQTT, async processing) now work correctly with the actual database schema. Structured error storage enables better debugging and monitoring of processing failures.

**Dependencies:** None - Critical foundational fix

**Quality Assurance:** 
✅ All raw_ingestions INSERT operations use correct column names  
✅ All raw_ingestions UPDATE operations align with schema
