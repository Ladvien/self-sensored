  "processed_count": 0,
  "processing_status": "accepted_for_processing",
  "message": "Large payload (15.2MB) accepted for background processing. Status: 'accepted_for_processing' - NO metrics have been processed yet..."
}
```

#### After Fix (Solution)
```json
{
  "success": true,   // CORRECT - request accepted successfully
  "processed_count": 0,  // ACCURATE - no processing yet
  "processing_status": "accepted_for_processing",
  "message": "Payload accepted for background processing. Use raw_ingestion_id {...} to check actual processing results via status API."
}
```

### Impact
